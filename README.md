# Rack::VersionHeader

Rack middleware for adding a (git|svn|you-name-it) version response header.

## Install

    gem install rack-version-header


## Usage

    require "rack/version_header"

    use Rack::VersionHeader,
      :header_name  => 'X-MyService-Version',   # default 'X-Version'
      :version_file => '.version'               # default '.version'

    run app

## Example usage with Git

Provided you have the `git` executable in your path you can add to your `config.ru`

    require "rack/version_header"

    gitsha = `git rev-parse --short HEAD`
    file   = File.dirname(__FILE__) + '/.gitsha'
    File.open(file, 'w') { |f| f.write(gitsha) }

    use Rack::VersionHeader,
      :header_name  => 'X-MyService-Git-Revision',
      :version_file => f.path

    run app

Then your response headers will look somewhat like

    HTTP/1.1 200 OK 
    Connection: Keep-Alive
    Content-Type: text/plain
    Date: Fri, 09 Apr 2010 11:25:07 GMT
    Server: WEBrick/1.3.1 (Ruby/1.8.7/2010-01-10)
    X-MyService-Git-Revision: 213addf
    Content-Length: 3370
